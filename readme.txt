WELCOME PEOPLES OF ALGORITHMS

Things of Note:
    - I have been using Objected Oriented Programming, but only recently truly understand what OOP is. 
    Therefore you will notice some of my code is OOP and some is procedural. Mainly, I have a few classes
    that handle different things, such as inventory, items, and money. But i have procedural functions
    that calculate prices. It all functions well, but isnt the prettiest. 

Proj1.py: the main vending machine. Totally runnable on its own. Relatively secure and looks decent.

VendingMachine.py: my attempt at incorporating a GUI into the vending machine. Have a little gui, entry,
and button, but i want to take the GUI input from the user and use that to run our code that is designed for 
a terminal. Im thinking we might need to basically copy the vending machine code and essentially change
print statements to label.config() and whatnot. Essentially convert terminal output to GUI output. Thanks
to my poor coding organization, this task has proved to be more difficult then I thought.

NEED TO DO:
- Transfer terminal functionality into GUI functionality
- Print out information to GUI (or make seperate window that is purely for output to user)

SIDE PROJECTS: 
- Add sounds effects for different functions
- Add pictures of items
